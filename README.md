## 🚀 Deployment Instructions for GitHub Pages

This project uses **Vite**. To host it correctly on GitHub Pages, do not just upload the source files. Follow these steps:

1. **Build the Project**: Run `npm install` and then `npm run build`.
2. **Upload the Output**: Copy everything inside the `dist` folder to your GitHub repository.
3. **Set Base Path**: The project is already configured with `base: './'` in `vite.config.ts` to ensure it works in subfolders.

### Features
- **AI Matching**: Powered by Gemini 3.
- **PWA Ready**: Installable on Android and iOS.
- **Privacy**: Built-in Ad-Blocker.
